# HexTiler
If, for some reason, you ever need to fit a fixed number of hexagons to tile a given rectangular region with minimum wastage, then you have come to the right place.

There's a dependency on [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) because I like pretty pictures.

Usage: `python hextiler.py WIDTH HEIGHT NUMBER`

Example: `python hextiler.py 15 10 7`
